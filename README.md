This is a rigid support piece for reinforcing a front handle of a F-one Strike v1 wing.  This makes it easier to control the wing when flagging it by the front handle and when flying it with one hand and a harness.  The extra stiffness allows more control over roll and pitch when flagging, lets you pull a bit of power from the wing while flagging, and makes it easier to push against the boom when using a harness.  It doesn't change the normal two-handled use of the handles.

Printed in Atomic Filament Carbon Fiber PETG

Assembly:

Insert the plastic insert inside 1in tubular webbing.
Sew both ends shut.
Sew the front edge of the insert to the webbing on the boom.
Wrap the back end of the insert and the front handle with hockey tape or similar.
